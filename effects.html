                    <h2> Environmental Effects </h2>
                    <p class="hyphen hyphen-env"></p>
                    <li>
                        Toxic Substances Leaching: Many electronic devices contain hazardous materials such as
                        lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants. When improperly disposed of,
                        these toxins can leach into the soil and groundwater, contaminating ecosystems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Soil and Water Pollution: E-waste, if left in landfills or incinerated, can release harmful
                        chemicals into the environment, leading to soil and water pollution. This can negatively
                        impact plant and aquatic life.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Air Pollution: Incineration of e-waste can release harmful gases and particulate matter
                        into the atmosphere, contributing to air pollution and potentially affecting human
                        respiratory health.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Electronic Waste Dumping: Illegally exporting e-waste to developing countries is a
                        common practice, leading to significant environmental problems in these regions. This
                        dumping often occurs due to lax regulations and low recycling costs.
                    </li>

                    <h2> Health Effects </h2>
                    <li>
                        Occupational Hazards: Workers in informal e-waste recycling sectors often face exposure
                        to toxic substances while dismantling and processing electronics. This can lead to a range
                        of health issues, including respiratory problems, skin disorders, and even cancer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Community Health: Nearby communities can be adversely affected by the pollution
                        generated from e-waste recycling facilities, leading to various health problems among
                        residents.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Emissions: When e-waste is incinerated or improperly treated, it releases pollutants into
                        the air, which can be inhaled by nearby populations, potentially causing respiratory and
                        cardiovascular diseases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Waterborne Contamination: E-waste can contaminate local water sources, affecting the
                        health of those who rely on them for drinking and irrigation.
                    </li>

                    <h2> Economic Effects </h2>
                    <li>
                        Resource Depletion: E-waste represents a valuable source of materials like precious
                        metals, rare earth elements, and plastics. When not properly recycled, these resources go
                        to waste, contributing to resource scarcity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lost Economic Opportunities: The lack of effective e-waste recycling systems can result
                        in lost economic opportunities. Proper recycling can create jobs, stimulate local
                        economies, and encourage innovation in green technologies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cleanup Costs: The cost of cleaning up contaminated sites and mitigating the
                        environmental damage caused by e-waste can be substantial, putting a financial burden
                        on governments and taxpayers.
